    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Coffee (or any other liquid)</li>
        <li>Mug (or any other container)</li>
        <li>Computer (or any other electronic device)</li>
        <li>Hot fat (optional)</li>
        <li>Batter (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place coffee mug in front of you, next to the workstation.</li>
        <li>Turn on your computer.</li>
        <li>Try to lift your coffee mug but instead you fail miserably and accidentally knock it over 
            all because Ted just had to come ask you for help right that moment and of course 
            Ted doesn't ever knock because "Where I grew up, we never felt the need to knock! Why? 
            Do you have something to hide?!" so now you've spilled the drink all over your 
            computer and your lap instantly burning half your upper left thigh with 3rd degree burns 
            because well you refuse to drink your coffee with any sort of milk in it and you 
            certainly don't have the patience to wait for three minutes and 26 seconds for the coffee 
            to cool down so now you're running screaming frantically trying to reach the bathroom 
            desperately reaching for any paper towels you can get your hand on and simultaneously 
            unbuttoning your new Levi's Jeans so you can begin to wipe the hot coffee off of yourself 
            but it's so hot the burn has penetrated your outer skin layer turning the fat to a glue 
            and now the pants are stuck to your skin and you can't get them off so now Bob the knob
            has to grab scissors to cut your pants off but of course being the absolute knob he is
            he cuts right into your femoral artery so now you're bleeding profusely screaming for help
            and blood is just continuing to jet out all over your shirt and the floor and walls until
            eventually you pass out from the shock of it all waking up just in time for the surgeon
            to start stitching up your leg in the operating room and you can't deal with this so once
            more everything fades to black until you awake from the beeping noises beside you and it's
            pitch black outside and you're alone in the hospital bed wondering what the heck just
            happened but oh well and then a grueling week later filled with pills and painkillers you
            are discharged just in time for you to return to work with nothing but permanent scarring
            on your left thigh and a deeply-rooted fear of hot coffee to show for it..
        
            <p>Moral of the story is: Your computer is definitely dead. "Yeahh, like... totally 
                deep fried.. my duuudee..".</p></li>
